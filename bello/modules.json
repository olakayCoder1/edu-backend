(Ph.D.) Department of Computer Science University of Ilorin 2 | P a g e Lesson 1 1.0 Data Communication & Computer Network Data communications refers to the transmission of digital data between two or more computers and a computer network or data network is a telecommunications network that allows computers to exchange data. The physical connection between networked computing devices is established using either cable media or wireless media. The best -known computer ne twork is the Internet. This tutorial should teach you basics of Data Communication and Computer Network (DCN) and will also take you through various advance concepts related to Data Communication and Computer Network. 1.1 Why to Learn Data Communication & Computer Network? 1.2.1 Network Basic Understanding A system of interconnected computers and computerized peripherals such as printers is called computer network. This interconnection among computers facilitates information sharing among them. Computers may connect to each other by either wired or wireless media. 1.3.1 Network Engineering Networking engineering is a complicated task, which involves software, firmware, chip level engineering, hardware, and electric pulses. To ease network engineering, the whole networking concept is divided into multiple layers. Each layer is involved in som e particular task and is independent of all other layers. But as a whole, almost all networking tasks depend on all of these layers. Layers share data between them and they depend on each other only to take input and send output. 1.3.2 Internet A network of networks is called an internetwork, or simply the internet. It is the largest network in existence on this planet. The internet hugely connects all WANs and it can have connection to LANs and Home networks. Internet uses TCP/IP protocol suite and uses IP as its addressing protocol. Present day, Internet is widely implemented using IPv4. Because of shortage of address spaces, it is gradually migrating from IPv4 to IPv6. Internet enables its users to share and access enormous amount of information worldwide. It uses WWW, FTP, email services, audio and video streaming etc. At huge level, internet works on Client -Server model. Internet uses very high-speed backbone of fiber optics. To inter -connect various continents, fibers are laid under sea known to us as submarine communication cable. 3 | P a g e 1.3.3 Applications of Communication & Computer Network Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network.

    "content": "5 | P a g e (i) Geographical Span Geographically a network can be seen in one of the following categories: It may be spanned across your table, among Bluetooth enabled devices,. Ranging not more than few meters. It may be spanned across a whole building, including intermediate devices to connect all floors. It may be spanned across a whole city. It may be spanned across multiple cities or provinces. It may be one network covering whole world. (ii) Inter -Connectivity Components of a network can be connected to each other differently in some fashion. By connectedness we mean either logically , physically , or both ways. Every single device can be connected to every other device on network, making the network mesh. All devices can be connected to a single medium but geographically disconnected, created bus like structure. Each device is connected to its left and right peers only, creating linear structure. All devices connected together with a single device, creating star like structure. All devices connected arbitrarily using all previous ways to connect each other, resulting in a hybrid structure. 5 | P a g e (iii) Administration From an administrator s point of view, a network can be private network which belongs a single autonomous system and cannot be accessed outside its physical or logical domain. A network can be public which is accessed by all. (iv) Network Architecture Computer networks can be discriminated into various types such as Client -Server,peer - to-peer or hybrid, depending upon its architecture. There can be one or more systems acting as Server. Other being Client, requests the Server to serve requests. Server takes and processes request on behalf of Clients. Two systems can be connected Point -to-Point, or in back -to-back fashion. They both reside at the same level and called peers. There can be hybrid network which involves network architecture of both the above types. 2.2 Network Applications Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network. They provide numerous advantages: Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices Exchange of information by means of e -Mails and FTP Information sharing by using Web or Internet Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages IP phones Video conferences Parallel computing Instant messaging 2.3 Computer Network Types Generally, networks are distinguished based on their geographical span.

    "summary": "Detailed explanation of Ethernet, its evolution, and different standards.",
    "content": "Ethernet is a widely deployed LAN technology. This technology was invented by Bob Metcalfe and D.R. Boggs in the year 1970. It was standardized in IEEE 802.3 in 1980. Ethernet shares media. Network which uses shared media has high probability of data collision. Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multi Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) technology to detect collisions. On the occurrence of collision in Ethernet, all its hosts roll back, wait for some random amount of time, and then re-transmit the data. Ethernet connector is, network interface card equipped with 48-bits MAC address. This helps other Ethernet devices to identify and communicate with remote devices in Ethernet. Traditional Ethernet uses 10BASE-T specifications. The number 10 depicts 10MBPS speed, BASE stands for baseband, and T stands for Thick Ethernet. 10BASE-T Ethernet provides transmission speed up to 10MBPS and uses coaxial cable or Cat-5 twisted pair cable with RJ-45 connector. Ethernet follows star topology with segment length up to 100 meters. All devices are connected to a hub/switch in a star fashion. To encompass need of fast emerging software and hardware technologies, Ethernet extends itself as Fast-Ethernet. It can run on UTP, Optical Fiber, and wirelessly too. It can provide speed up to 100 MBPS. This standard is named as 100BASE-T in IEEE 803.2 using Cat-5 twisted pair cable. It uses CSMA/CD technique for wired media sharing among the Ethernet hosts and CSMA/CA (CA stands for Collision Avoidance) technique for wireless Ethernet LAN. Fast Ethernet on fiber is defined under 100BASE-FX standard which provides speed up to 100 MBPS on fiber. Ethernet over fiber can be extended up to 100 meters in half-duplex mode and can reach maximum of 2000 meters in full-duplex over multimode fibers. After being introduced in 1995, Fast-Ethernet could enjoy its high speed status only for 3 years till Giga-Ethernet introduced. Giga-Ethernet provides speed up to 1000 mbits/seconds.",

LAN uses Ethernet which in turn works on shared media. Shared media in Ethernet create one single Broadcast domain and one single Collision domain. Introduction of switches to Ethernet has removed single collision domain issue and each device connected to switch works in its separate collision domain. But even Switches cannot divide a network into separate Broadcast domains. Virtual LAN is a solution to divide a single Broadcast domain into multiple Broadcast domains. Host in one VLAN cannot speak to a host in another. By default, all hosts are placed into the same VLAN. In this diagram, different VLANs are depicted in different color codes. Hosts in one VLAN, even if connected on the same Switch cannot see or speak to other hosts in different VLANs. VLAN is Layer-2 technology which works closely on Ethernet. To route packets between two different VLANs a Layer-3 device such as Router is required.",

In layered communication system, one layer of a host deals with the task done by or to be done by its peer layer at the same level on the remote host. The task is either initiated by layer at the lowest level or at the top most level. If the task is initiated by the -top most layer, it is passed on to the layer below it for further processing.

Common people may send the data that can be highly sensitive such as their bank credentials, username and passwords, personal documents, online shopping details, or confidential documents. All security threats are intentional i.e. they occur only if intentionally triggered. Security threats can be divided into the following categories: (i) Interruption Interruption is a security threat in which availability of resources is attacked. For example, a user is unable to access its web-server or the web-server is hijacked. (ii) Privacy-Breach In this threat, the privacy of a user is compromised. Someone, who is not the authorized person is accessing or intercepting data sent or received by the original authenticated user. (iii) Integrity This type of threat includes any alteration or modification in the original context of communication. The attacker intercepts and receives the data sent by the sender and the attacker then either modifies or generates false data and sends to the receiver. The receiver receives the data assuming that it is being sent by the original Sender. (iv) Authenticity This threat occurs when an attacker or a security violator, poses as a genuine person and accesses the resources or communicates with other genuine users. No technique in the present world can provide 100% security. But steps can be taken to secure data while it travels in unsecured network or internet.

There are several cryptographic algorithms available present day as described below: (i) Secret Key (ii) Public Key (iii) Message Digest (i) Secret Key Encryption Both sender and receiver have one secret key. This secret key is used to encrypt the data at sender\\s end. After the data is encrypted, it is sent on the public domain to the receiver. Because the receiver knows and has the Secret Key, the encrypted data p ackets can easily be decrypted. Example of secret key encryption is Data Encryption Standard (DES). In Secret Key encryption, it is required to have a separate key for each host on the network making it difficult to manage. (ii) Public Key Encryption In this encryption system, every user has its own Secret Key and it is not in the shared domain. The secret key is never revealed on public domain. Along with secret key, every user has its own but public key. Public key is always made public and is used b y Senders to encrypt the data. When the user receives the encrypted data, he can easily decrypt it by using its own Secret Key. Example of public key encryption is Rivest \\-Shamir \\-Adleman (RSA). (iii) Message Digest In this method, actual data is not sent, instead a hash value is calculated and sent. The other end user, computes its own hash value and compares with the one just received. If both hash values are matched, then it is accepted otherwise rejected. Example of Message Digest is MD5 hashing. It is mostly used in authentication where user password is cross checked with the one saved on the server.",

    "name": "Physical Layer Introduction",
    "summary": "Overview of the physical layer in the OSI model, including signals, transmission impairments, noise, and transmission media.",
    "content": "Introduction Physical layer in the OSI model plays the role of interacting with actual hardware and signaling mechanism. Physical layer is the only layer of OSI network model which actually deals with the physical connectivity of two different stations. This layer defines the hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies, pulses used to represent bina ry signals etc. Physical layer provides its services to Data \\-link layer. Data \\-link layer hands over frames to physical layer. Physical layer converts them to electrical pulses, which represent binary data.The binary data is then sent over the wired or wireless media. 6.1 Signals When data is sent over physical medium, it needs to be first converted into electromagnetic signals. Data itself can be analog such as human voice, or digital such as file on the disk. Both analog and digital data can be represented in digital or analog signals. (i) Digital Signals Digital signals are discrete in nature and represent sequence of voltage pulses. Digital signals are used within the circuitry of a computer system. (ii) Analog Signals Analog signals are in continuous wave form in nature and represented by continuous electromagnetic waves. 6.2 Transmission Impairment When signals travel through the medium they tend to deteriorate. This may have many reasons as given: (i) Attenuation For the receiver to interpret the data accurately, the signal must be sufficiently strong.When the signal passes through the medium, it tends to get weaker.As it covers distance, it loses strength. (ii) Dispersion As signal travels through the media, it tends to spread and overlaps. The amount of dispersion depends upon the frequency used. (iii) Delay distortion Signals are sent over media with pre \\-defined speed and frequency. If the signal speed and frequency do not match, there are possibilities that signal reaches destination in arbitrary fashion. In digital media, this is very critical that some bits reach earlier than the previously sent ones. 6.3 Noise Random disturbance or fluctuation in analog or digital signal is said to be Noise in signal, which may distort the actual information being carried. Noise can be characterized in one of the following class: (i) Thermal Noise Heat agitates the electronic conductors of a medium which may introduce noise in the media. Up to a certain level, thermal noise is unavoidable. (ii) Intermodulation When multiple frequencies share a medium, their interference can cause noise in the medium. Intermodulation noise occurs if two different frequencies are sharing a medium and one of them has excessive strength or the component itself is not functioning pro perly, then the resultant frequency may not be delivered as expected. (iii) Crosstalk This sort of noise happens when a foreign signal enters into the media. This is because signal in one medium affects the signal of second medium. (iv) Impulse This noise is introduced because of irregular disturbances such as lightening, electricity, short \\- circuit, or faulty components. Digital data is mostly affected by this sort of noise. 6.4 Transmission Media The media over which the information between two computer systems is sent, called transmission media. Transmission media comes in two forms. (i) Guided Media All communication wires/cables are guided media, such as UTP, coaxial cables, and fiber Optics. In this media, the sender and receiver are directly connected and the information is send (guided) through it. (ii) Unguided Media Wireless or open air space is said to be unguided media, because there is no connectivity between the sender and receiver. Information is spread over the air, and anyone including the actual recipient may collect the information. 6.5 Channel Capacity The speed of transmission of information is said to be the channel capacity. We count it as data rate in digital world. It depends on numerous factors such as: (i) Bandwidth: The physical limitation of underlying media. (ii) Error \\-rate: Incorrect reception of information because of noise. (iii) Encoding: The number of levels used for signaling. 6.6 Multiplexing Multiplexing is a technique to mix and send multiple data streams over a single medium.",

If the next hop is not having enough resource to accommodate large size message, the message is store d and switch waits. This technique was considered substitute to circuit switching. As in circuit switching the whole path is blocked for two entities only. Message switching is replaced by packet switching.\n\nMessage switching has the following drawbacks: Every switch in transit path needs enough storage to accommodate entire message. Because of store -and-forward technique and waits included until resources are available, message switching is very slow. Message switching was not a solution for streaming media and real -time applications. Shortcomings of message switching gave birth to an idea of packet switching. The entire message is broken down into smaller chunks called packets. The switching information is added in the header of each packet and transmitted independently. It is easier for intermediate networking devices to store small size packets and they do not take much resources either on carrier path or in the internal memory of switches.

These are: Framing Data -link layer takes packets from Network Layer and encapsulates them into Frames.Then, it sends each frame bit -by-bit on the hardware. At receiver end, data link layer picks up signals from hardware and assembles them into frames. Addressing Data -link layer provides layer -2 hardware addressing mechanism. Hardware address is assumed to be unique on the link. It is encoded into hardware at the time of manufacturing. Synchronization When data frames are sent on the link, both machines must be synchronized in order to transfer to take place. Error Control Sometimes signals may have encountered problem in transition and the bits are flipped.These errors are detected and attempted to recover actual data bits. It also provides error reporting mechanism to the sender. Flow Control Stations on same link may have different speed or capacity. Data -link layer ensures flow control that enables both machine to exchange data on same speed. Multi -Access When host on the shared link tries to transfer the data, it has a high probability of collision. Data -link layer provides mechanism such as CSMA/CD to equip capability of accessing a shared media among multiple Systems.",

In both cases, few extra bits are sent along with actual data to confirm that bits received at other end are same as they were sent. If the counter -check at receiver end fails, the bits are considered corrupted. Parity Check One extra bit is sent along with the original bits to make number of 1s either even in case of even parity, or odd in case of odd parity. The sender while creating a frame counts the number of 1s in it. For example, if even parity is used and number of 1s is even then one bit with value 0 is added. This way number of 1s remains even.If the number of 1s is odd, to make it even a bit with valu e 1 is added. The receiver simply counts the number of 1s in a frame. If the count of 1s is even and even parity is used, the frame is considered to be not -corrupted and is accepted. If the count of 1s is odd and odd parity is used, the frame is still not corrupted. If a single bit flips in transit, the receiver can detect it by counting the number of 1s. But when more than one bits are erro neous, then it is very hard for the receiver to detect the error. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) CRC is a different approach to detect if the received frame contains valid data.",

    "content": "In the digital world, error correction can be done in two ways: Backward Error Correction When the receiver detects an error in the data received, it requests back the sender to retransmit the data unit. Forward Error Correction When the receiver detects some error in the data received, it executes error-correcting code, which helps it to auto-recover and to correct some kinds of errors. The first one, Backward Error Correction, is simple and can only be efficiently used where retransmitting is not expensive. For example, fiber optics. But in case of wireless transmission retransmitting may cost too much. In the latter case, Forward Error Correction is used. To correct the error in data frame, the receiver must know exactly which bit in the frame is corrupted. To locate the bit in error, redundant bits are used as parity bits for error detection. For example, we take ASCII words (7 bits data), then there could be 8 kind of information we need: first seven bits to tell us which bit is error and one more bit to tell that there is no error. For m data bits, r redundant bits are used. r bits can provide 2r combinations of information. In m+r bit codeword, there is possibility that the r bits themselves may get corrupted. So the number of r bits used must inform about m+r bit locations plus no-error information, i.e. m+r+1.",

    "summary": "This module covers flow and error control mechanisms in the data-link layer.",
    "content": "Data-link layer is responsible for implementation of point-to-point flow and error control mechanism. 15.1 Flow Control When a data frame (Layer-2 data) is sent from one host to another over a single medium, it is required that the sender and receiver should work at the same speed. That is, sender sends at a speed on which the receiver can process and accept the data. What if the speed (hardware/software) of the sender or receiver differs? If sender is sending too fast the receiver may be overloaded, (swamped) and data may be lost. Two types of mechanisms can be deployed to control the flow: Stop and Wait This flow control mechanism forces the sender after transmitting a data frame to stop and wait until the acknowledgement of the data-frame sent is received. Sliding Window In this flow control mechanism, both sender and receiver agree on the number of data-frames after which the acknowledgement should be sent. As we learnt, stop and wait flow control mechanism wastes resources, this protocol tries to make use of underlying resources as much as possible. 15.2 Error Control When data-frame is transmitted, there is a probability that data-frame may be lost in the transit or it is received corrupted. In both cases, the receiver does not receive the correct data-frame and sender does not know anything about any loss. In such case, both sender and receiver are equipped with some protocols which helps them to detect transit errors such as loss of data-frame. Hence, either the sender retransmits the data-frame or the receiver may request to resend the previous data-frame. Requirements for error control mechanism: Error detection - The sender and receiver, either both or any, must ascertain that there is some error in the transit. Positive ACK - When the receiver receives a correct frame, it should acknowledge it. Negative ACK - When the receiver receives a damaged frame or a duplicate frame, it sends a NACK back to the sender and the sender must retransmit the correct frame. Retransmission: The sender maintains a clock and sets a timeout period. If an acknowledgement of a data-frame previously transmitted does not arrive before the timeout the sender retransmits the frame, thinking that the frame or its acknowledgement is lost in transit. There are three types of techniques available which Data-link layer may deploy to control the errors by Automatic Repeat Requests (ARQ): Stop-and-wait ARQ The following transition may occur in Stop-and-Wait ARQ: o The sender maintains a timeout counter. o When a frame is sent, the sender starts the timeout counter. o If acknowledgement of frame comes in time, the sender transmits the next frame in queue. o If acknowledgement does not come in time, the sender assumes that either the frame or its acknowledgement is lost in transit. Sender retransmits the frame and starts the timeout counter. o If a negative acknowledgement is received, the sender retransmits the frame. Go-Back-N ARQ Stop and wait ARQ mechanism does not utilize the resources at their best. When the acknowledgement is received, the sender sits idle and does nothing. In Go-Back-N ARQ method, both sender and receiver maintain a window. The sending-window size enables the sender to send multiple frames without receiving the acknowledgement of the previous ones. The receiving-window enables the receiver to receive multiple frames and acknowledge them. The receiver keeps track of incoming frames sequence number. When the sender sends all the frames in window, it checks up to what sequence number it has received positive acknowledgement. If all frames are positively acknowledged, the sender sends next set of frames. If sender finds that it has received NACK or has not receive any ACK for a particular frame, it retransmits all the frames after which it does not receive any positive ACK.",

Two different subnet may have different addressing schemes or non-compatible addressing types. Same with protocols, two different subnet may b e operating on different protocols which are not compatible with each other. Network layer has the responsibility to route the packets from source to destination, mapping different addressing schemes and protocols. Devices which work on Network Layer mainly focus on routing. Routing may include various tasks aimed to achieve a single goal. These can be: Addressing devices and networks. Populating routing tables or static routes. Queuing incoming and outgoing data and then forwarding them according to quality of service constraints set for those packets. Internetworking between two different subnets. Delivering packets to destination with best efforts. Provides connection oriented and connection less mechanism. With its standard functionalities, Layer 3 can provide various features as: Quality of service management Load balancing and link management Security Interrelation of different protocols and subnets with different schema. Different logical network design over the physical network design. L3 VPN and tunnels can be used to provide end to end dedicated connectivity. Internet protocol is widely respected and deployed Network Layer protocol which helps to communicate end to end devices over the internet. It comes in two flavors.

    "content": "Layer 3 network addressing is one of the major tasks of Network Layer. Network Addresses are always logical i.e. these are software based addresses which can be changed by appropriate configurations. A network address always points to host / node / server or it can represent a whole network. Network address is always configured on network interface card and is generally mapped by system with the MAC address (hardware address or layer -2 address) of the machine for Layer -2 communication. There are different kinds of network addresses in existence: IP IPX AppleTalk We are discussing IP here as it is the only one we use in practice these days. IP addressing provides mechanism to differentiate between hosts and network. Because IP addresses are assigned in hierarchical manner, a host always resides under a specific network. The host which needs to communicate outside its subnet, needs to know destination network address, where the packet/data is to be sent. Hosts in different subnet need a mechanism to locate each other. This task can be done by DNS. DNS is a server which provides Layer-3 address of remote host mapped with its domain name or FQDN. When a host acquires the Layer-3 Address (IP Address) of the remote host, it forwards all its packet to its gateway. A gateway is a router equipped with all the information which leads to route packets to the destination host. Routers take help of routing tables, which has the following information: Method to reach the network Routers upon receiving a forwarding request, forwards packet to its next hop (adjacent router) towards the destination. The next router on the path follows the same thing and eventually the data packet reaches its destination. Network address can be of one of the following: Unicast (destined to one host) Multicast (destined to group) Broadcast (destined to all) Anycast (destined to nearest one) A router never forwards broadcast traffic by default. Multicast traffic uses special treatment as it is most a video stream or audio with highest priority. Anycast is just similar to unicast, except that the packets are delivered to the nearest destination when multiple destinations are available.",

A router is always configured with some default route. A default route tells the router where to forward a packet if there is no route found for specific destination. In case there are multiple path existing to reach the same destination, router can make decision based on the following information: Hop Count Bandwidth Metric Prefix-length Delay Routes can be statically configured or dynamically learnt. One route can be configured to be preferred over others. Most of the traffic on the internet and intranets known as unicast data or unicast traffic is sent with specified destination. Routing unicast data over the internet is called unicast routing. It is the simplest form of routing because the destination is already known. Hence the router just has to look up the routing table and forward the packet to next hop. By default, the broadcast packets are not routed and forwarded by the routers on any network. Routers create broadcast domains.",

All packets are sent as unicast but because they are sent to all, it simulates as if router is broadcasting. This method consumes lots of bandwidth and router must destination address of each node. Secondly, when router receives a packet that is to be broadcasted, it simply floods those packets out of all interfaces. All routers are configured in the same way. This method is easy on router's CPU but may cause the problem of duplicate packets received from peer routers.
